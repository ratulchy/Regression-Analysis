#Multiple linear Regression-Analysis
Regression analysis with dummy variables, multicollinearity problems and endogeneity problems

In this project, we first use U.S. CPS survey data in AER package to see the application of dummy variables in Regression. Next, we use CASschool dataset with data on school test performance and student demographics to examine the existence of a multicollinearity problem. Finally, we use the Housing Prices dataset to trace the existence of an omitted variable bias.
